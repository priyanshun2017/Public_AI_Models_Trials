Task Title:
Implement PyNVMe Test Cases for NVMe 2.0 Queue Creation, Deletion, and Usage

Prompt:
You are a senior storage firmware and NVMe test engineer.

Create PyNVMe-based test cases compliant with NVMe 2.0 that validate Admin Queue and I/O Queue behavior, with focus on queue creation, usage, and deletion.

Scope:

1. Admin Queue Validation
- Verify Admin Submission Queue (ASQ) and Admin Completion Queue (ACQ) initialization
- Validate queue depth, memory alignment, and doorbell behavior
- Verify controller enablement and readiness (CC.EN, CSTS.RDY)

2. I/O Queue Creation
- Create I/O Completion Queues using the Create IO Completion Queue admin command
- Create I/O Submission Queues using the Create IO Submission Queue admin command
- Validate:
  - Queue IDs and uniqueness
  - Queue size limits as defined by NVMe 2.0
  - Interrupt vector configuration or polling mode
  - Contiguous vs non-contiguous memory handling

3. I/O Queue Usage
- Submit NVMe Read and Write commands through created queues
- Validate:
  - Command submission and completion
  - Completion Queue Entry fields (CID, SQID, SQHD, Status Field)
  - Phase tag toggling
  - Correct doorbell register updates

4. I/O Queue Deletion
- Delete I/O Submission Queues before deleting I/O Completion Queues as required by spec
- Validate error handling for:
  - Deleting active queues
  - Deleting non-existent queues
  - Invalid deletion order

5. Negative and Edge Test Cases
- Queue size set to zero
- Queue size exceeding controller-reported limits
- Duplicate Queue IDs
- Submitting commands to deleted queues
- Controller reset while I/O queues are active

Requirements:
- Use PyNVMe APIs with idiomatic Python test structure
- Follow NVMe 2.0 specification terminology
- Each test case must include:
  - Purpose
  - Preconditions
  - Test Steps
  - Expected Results

Test Organization:
- test_admin_queue.py
- test_io_queue_create.py
- test_io_queue_usage.py
- test_io_queue_delete.py

Output:
- Runnable PyNVMe Python test code
- Inline comments referencing NVMe 2.0 behavior
- Clear separation of positive and negative tests

Constraints:
- Linux environment
- NVMe 2.0 compliant controller
- Real hardware execution (no mocking)

Deliver spec-compliant, review-ready test cases suitable for automated execution and Antigravity review workflow.
